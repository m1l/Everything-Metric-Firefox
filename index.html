There are many other "creative" ways to write foot, inch and their symbols.
Per ISO 31-1 the symbol for the inch is "in" which is also denoted with a double prime symbol ″

but people also write these capital letters ("In", "IN"), full words ("Inch) with or without first letter in uppercase, and use improper variations of double prime symbol as quotes (”), double apostrophes (’’), twice typed prime character (′′), and other ways. One inch can be seen written as

1"
1″
1”
1’’ - two apostrophes
1′′ - twice typed prime character
1'' - twice typed single quote character
1in
1 in
1 In
1 IN
1 inch
1 Inch

Half an inch can be seen written as:

1/2″
½″ - fraction as a single Unicode character
1⁄2″ - fraction as 3 characters
0.5″
.5″

plus all other variations of the symbol ″ listed above.

Per ISO 31-1 the symbol for the foot is "ft" which is also denoted with prime symbol ′
One foot can be seen written as

1 foot
1'
1’
1′
1ft
1-ft
1 ft
1 Ft - but Hungarian Forint will also use Ft; Option is needed to exclude this
2 feet

One and a half inch can be seen written in various ways with various different ways the spaces, dashes and other symbols are used. These are some of the ways this can be seen in various websites:

1 1/2"
1 1/2″
1 1/2”
1 1/2’’
1 1/2′′
1 1/2''

The measurements above several inches are written as a combination of feet and inches, and can be seen written in many different ways:

2′4″
2'4"
2’4’’
2’4”
2′ 4″
2' 4"
2’ 4’’
2’ 4”
2′−4″
2'−4"
2’−4’’
2’−4”

The next four should use a comma as decimal separator if set as such.

2 ft 4 in
2ft 4in
2ft-4in
2 foot 4 inches
5 ft 3" - Google will show person's height as this

This creates an issue because the same symbols internationally represent time: 2′ 4″ is 2 minutes and 4 seconds.
so this should not be converted:

3° 5′ 30″
3° 5' 30"

Volume in USCS

There are fluid and dry volume units in USCS, and for example, a dry gallon is a different volume than a fluid gallon. The extension assumes that the fluid units are used instead of the dry units, as these are more common, although many write fluid ounces as simply oz, and the extension cannot know which ones are meant.

All following measurements denote the same volume:

1 gallons
1 gal
4 quarts
4 qt
8 pint
8 pt
16 cp
16 cups
128 fl oz
128 fl ounces
128 fl.oz

There are also other USCS units for fluid volume like a barrel, shot, gill, hogshead... which are ignored by the extension as these are less commonly used.

The gallon, quart, pint, cups and the rest are different in the UK, and the extension checks for the website's domain is .UK to switch to Imperial units instead of USCS.

There are also measurements of Teaspoon and Tablespoon, but each country assumes different volume for both, as with the cup.

1 tablespoon
1 tablespoons
1 tbsp
1tbsp
1Tbsp
3 teaspoon
3 teaspoons
3 tsp

Cups are different depending on a country: Australia and Canada (250 mL), U.K. (284.13 mL), U.S. (236.59 mL). Even in the U.S., there is a difference in volume between a US tablespoon (14.79 mL) and a US tablespoon used by the FDA (15 mL). The same difference within the U.S. exists also for Teaspoons and Cups.

1 Cup
1 cup
2 cups

Weight in USCS

In the U.S. a pound of feathers weighs more than a pound of gold (453 g / 373 g), but an ounce of feathers less than an ounce of gold (38 g / 31 g). This is because one is Avoirdupois pound/ounce and the other is US Troy pound/ounce. Troy units are used for precious metals only.

A weight of one pound can be seen written as

1 pound
1 lbs
1 lb
16 ounces
16 oz
16 Oz
16 OZ
16oz

USCS also has a "short ton" and a "long ton", dram, bushel, and grain. The extension does not convert those units as they are rarely used. For the "ton" conversion it wouldn't be possible to determine which one it is, as these have different weights, and it would be also possible to confuse it with a metric ton (1000 kg) with the same abbreviation "t".
